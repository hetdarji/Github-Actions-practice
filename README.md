# My GitHub Actions Learning Project

Welcome to my GitHub Actions Learning Project! This is a simple project created to demonstrate my understanding and exploration of **GitHub Actions** and how CI/CD pipelines work directly within GitHub.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Project Overview

In this project, I explored the use of GitHub Actions for automating workflows, including continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) processes. GitHub Actions enables developers to automate tasks like running tests, deploying code, or even triggering workflows for pull requests.

By setting up simple workflows, I was able to experiment with:

- Running tests automatically on each push.
- Building and deploying code automatically.
- Understanding and creating YAML configuration files for workflows.

This project is primarily for educational purposes to showcase my understanding of **GitHub Actions** and how they can simplify the development workflow.

## üöÄ Learning GitHub Actions

### What is GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions allows you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository. You can automate tasks like:

- Running code linting or tests when changes are made to the repository.
- Deploying your project to production or staging after a successful commit or pull request merge.
- Managing workflow triggers using `.yaml` files that define actions based on various events (e.g., push, pull request).

### Key Learnings

- **Workflows**: Workflows are defined in `.yml` files and can be triggered by specific events such as `push`, `pull_request`, etc.
- **Actions**: GitHub Actions allows you to run tasks defined by community-contributed actions or custom scripts.
- **CI/CD**: Implementing continuous integration to automatically run tests and continuous deployment to deploy code changes to various environments.
- **Matrix Builds**: Running tests in parallel with matrix builds to test multiple versions of a language or dependencies.

If you're new to GitHub Actions, I highly recommend checking out the official [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for more detailed information on setting up workflows.

## üì¶ Features

- **Automated Testing**: This project is set up with a simple GitHub Action to run tests automatically on every push.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: The project demonstrates how you can set up a deployment pipeline to deploy your project to a remote server after a successful test pass.
